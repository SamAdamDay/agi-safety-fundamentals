AGI Safety Fundamentals Technical Alignment Curriculum Summaries
================================================================

These are my personal summaries of the core readings for the [AGI Safety Fundamentals Technical Alignment Curriculum](https://www.agisafetyfundamentals.com/ai-alignment-curriculum). This is part of a reading group being run by [Oxford Artificial Intelligence Society](https://oxai.org/).

The notes are written in LaTeX. See the [compiled PDF](Summaries/summaries.pdf).


Disclaimers
-----------

- These are just notes I'm making as I read the material. *The primary audience is me*. I make no attempt to make them easily readable/accessible/useful.
- There are loads of typos.
