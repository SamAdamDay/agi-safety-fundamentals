\section{Specification gaming: the flip side of AI ingenuity}

\url{https://deepmindsafetyresearch.medium.com/specification-gaming-the-flip-side-of-ai-ingenuity-c85bdb0deeb4}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Specification gaming can be a good thing, if the goal is correctly specified.
    \item More powerful learning more likely to do specification gaming.
    \item Desirability of novel solutions lies on a spectrum.
    \item Causes of specification gaming.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Poor reward shaping: extra rewards on the way to the final one.
        \item Poor final outcome specification.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Can use human feedback to learn reward function.
            \item This itself may suffer specification gaming: agent performing grasping task learned to fool human exploiting optical illusion.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Simulator bugs.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item About failure of abstraction exploited by agent.
            \item Analogously, real-world traffic optimiser assumes that there aren't bugs in software controlling traffic which can be exploited.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Reward tampering: changing mechanism by which it gets rewarded in real world.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item E.g.\@ by manipulating humans.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item At least three challenges.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Faithfully capture human concept of task.
        \item Avoid making mistakes in implicit assumptions about domain.
        \item Avoid reward tampering.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Risks from learned optimization}

\url{https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/FkgsxrGf3QxhfLWHG}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Mesa-optimiser}: learned model which is itself an optimiser.
    \item When will this happen?
    \item What will the objective be?
    \item Whether is system is an optimiser is a property of its internal structure.
    \item \emph{Base optimiser}: algo which produced the model.
\end{itemize}
